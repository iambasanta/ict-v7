# net is an acronym for Node.js, Express.js and Typescript

This is a boilerplate project for building an Express.js application with TypeScript. It provides a basic project structure and configurations to help you get started quickly with building a backend server using TypeScript.

### Scripts

#### Run the application in development mode with live-reloading using `nodemon`

```bash
npm run dev
```

#### Build the TypeScript code and generate the compiled JavaScript files in the `build/` directory

```bash
npm run build
```

#### Start the server using the compiled JavaScript files in the `dist/` directory

```bash
npm start
```
